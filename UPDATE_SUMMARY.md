## 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### 1. **Naming Consistency** 🔄
**Issue:** App uses "students" but should align with course terminology

**Files that need updating:**
- `app/students/page.tsx` - Rename to members or keep as students?
- `app/forms/page.tsx` - References "students"
- `app/insights/page.tsx` - References "student data"
- `app/settings/page.tsx` - Hardcoded "students"
- Various API routes and components

**Decision needed:** 
- Keep "students" since we now have `courses:read` permission?
- Or use "members" for community focus?

### 2. **Revenue Tracking Enhancement** 🔄
**Need to add:**
- API route to fetch `company:balance:read` data
- Invoice tracking integration
- Refund/dispute impact on revenue calculations
- Better MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) tracking

**Status:** Not started yet

### 3. **Frontend Course Analytics** 🔄
**Need to create:**
- Course overview dashboard
- Student progress tracking UI
- Lesson completion charts
- Course engagement metrics

**Status:** Not started yet

---

## ⏳ PENDING

### 1. **API Routes Audit** ⏳
**Need to verify:**
- All routes use correct client_id → UUID flow
- All routes respect new permissions
- Error handling is consistent
- Rate limiting is appropriate

### 2. **Full Integration Testing** ⏳
**Need to test:**
- Course sync from Whop API
- Progress tracking workflow
- Webhook event handling
- Revenue calculations with refunds/disputes
- Permission enforcement

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE** - Run database migration:
   ```sql
   -- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
   \i database/add-course-tables.sql
   ```

2. **HIGH PRIORITY** - Test course sync:
   ```bash
   POST /api/courses/sync
   # Should fetch and sync all courses from Whop
   ```

3. **HIGH PRIORITY** - Decide on naming:
   - Are we tracking "students" (course-focused)?
   - Or "members" (community-focused)?
   - Update terminology consistently

4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Add revenue tracking:
   - Create `/api/revenue/balance` endpoint
   - Integrate `company:balance:read` permission
   - Update analytics to show accurate revenue with refunds

5. **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Build course analytics UI:
   - Create `/courses` page
   - Show course list with enrollment stats
   - Show individual course progress
   - Display completion rates

6. **LOW PRIORITY** - Update documentation:
   - Update README with new features
   - Document course tracking workflow
   - Add API endpoint documentation

## 📋 TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Run database migration successfully
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly
- [ ] Test course sync endpoint
- [ ] Test progress tracking endpoint
- [ ] Verify webhooks handle refunds/disputes
- [ ] Check that client_id → UUID flow works everywhere
- [ ] Test with real Whop data
- [ ] Verify permission enforcement
- [ ] Check frontend displays new data
- [ ] Load test with multiple courses

## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Whop API Structure Unknown**
   - The course sync API assumes a certain response format
   - Need to verify actual Whop API response structure
   - May need adjustments based on real data

2. **Naming Inconsistency**
   - "Students" used throughout but app also serves communities
   - Need to align terminology with actual use case

3. **No Frontend Yet**
   - All backend is ready but no UI to display course data
   - Users can't see the new features yet

4. **Testing Needed**
   - No integration tests written yet
   - Need to verify everything works with real Whop data
