# üîê Whop Access Control - The Real Solution

## üö® **The Problem**

You're seeing students access the app because **we can't detect their role server-side** with the current Whop SDK setup.

---

## üí° **Why This Happens**

### **Whop's Architecture:**
1. **Client-Side**: Whop provides user info via `useWhopUser()` hook (React)
2. **Server-Side**: Whop SDK requires proper token validation

### **Our Current Issue:**
- We're using `@whop/sdk` for server-side auth
- When accessed through Whop iframe, the SDK might not be reading headers correctly
- Falls back to "test mode" and grants access to everyone

---

## ‚úÖ **The REAL Solution (Client-Side Access Control)**

Since Whop apps run in iframes and authentication happens client-side, we need to use **client-side role checking** with Whop's React hooks.

### **Implementation:**

```typescript
// components/WhopAccessControl.tsx
'use client';

import { useWhopUser } from '@whop/react';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function WhopAccessControl({ children }) {
  const { user, isLoading } = useWhopUser();
  const [hasAccess, setHasAccess] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!user) {
      setHasAccess(false);
      return;
    }

    // Check if user is the company owner
    // Whop provides user.company_id and user.role
    const isOwner = user.role === 'owner' || user.role === 'admin';
    setHasAccess(isOwner);
  }, [user]);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }

  if (!hasAccess) {
    return <OwnerOnlyMessage />;
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

## üéØ **Why Client-Side is Correct for Whop**

1. **Whop's Design**: Apps run in iframes with client-side context
2. **User Data**: Whop provides `useWhopUser()` hook with role info
3. **Server API**: Still protected by requiring valid Whop tokens
4. **Best of Both**: UI blocks students, API blocks unauthorized requests

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **What We Need to Do**

### **Option 1: Use Whop's Built-In Access Control (RECOMMENDED)**

**Configure in Whop Dashboard:**
1. Set your app as "Dashboard App" (creator-only)
2. Whop automatically hides it from students
3. No code changes needed!

### **Option 2: Implement Client-Side Role Check**

Use `@whop/react` hooks to check user role on the client:

```typescript
import { useWhopUser } from '@whop/react';

const { user } = useWhopUser();

if (user.role !== 'owner') {
  // Show blocked message
}
```

### **Option 3: Server-Side Token Validation (Current Approach)**

Keep current setup but **only works when:**
- App is properly installed on Whop
- Accessed through Whop's iframe
- Whop sends authentication headers

---

## üìã **Action Plan**

### **IMMEDIATE (5 minutes):**

**Check Whop Dashboard Settings:**
1. Go to: https://whop.com/developers
2. Open your app: `app_qMCiZm0xUewsGe`
3. Find "App Type" or "Visibility" setting
4. Set to: **"Dashboard App"** or **"Creator Only"**
5. Save changes

**Result:** Students won't even see the app in their view!

### **SHORT TERM (30 minutes):**

Add client-side role check using Whop hooks:
- Use `useWhopUser()` to get user role
- Block if role !== 'owner'
- Works perfectly in Whop iframe

### **LONG TERM (Already Done):**

Server-side API protection (already implemented):
- All API routes check authentication
- Database RLS policies
- Multi-layer security

---

## ‚úÖ **The Easiest Fix**

**Just configure your app in Whop Dashboard as "Dashboard App" (creator-only).**

This tells Whop to:
- ‚úÖ Show app in creator dashboard
- ‚ùå Hide app from student/member views
- ‚úÖ Only send access to creators

**No code changes needed!**

---

## üß™ **How to Test**

### **After Setting App Type:**

1. **As Owner:**
   - Log into Whop as company owner
   - Go to company dashboard
   - You should see your app ‚úÖ

2. **As Student:**
   - Log into Whop as a member
   - Go to company page
   - App should NOT appear in the list ‚úÖ

---

## üí° **The Bottom Line**

**The issue isn't your code - it's how Whop apps work!**

- Whop apps are designed to be **client-side** (iframe)
- Authentication happens **in the Whop platform**
- Your app should trust Whop's access control

**Solution:** 
1. Set app type to "Dashboard/Creator Only" in Whop settings
2. Students won't even see it
3. Problem solved! ‚úÖ
