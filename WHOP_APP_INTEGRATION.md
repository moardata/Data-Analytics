   - Create developer account
   - Register new app

2. **App Configuration**
   ```

   Description: "Collect feedback and analytics from your students"
   Redirect URL: https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/whop/callback
   Webhook URL: https://your-app.vercel.app/api/whop/webhook
   ```

3. **Get App Credentials**

### **Step 2: Configure Your App**

**Add to your environment variables:**
```env
WHOP_APP_ID=your_app_id
WHOP_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

**Update your app to handle Whop authentication:**
```typescript
// lib/auth/whop-app-auth.ts
export async function authenticateWhopUser(token: string) {
  // Verify token with Whop API
  // Return user info and permissions
}
```

### **Step 3: Students Access Your App**

**How students get to your surveys:**

## **🎯 Method 2: Direct URL Sharing**

### **Step 1: Get Survey URLs**

**From your forms page:**
1. Go to `/forms`
2. Click "Share" on any survey
3. Get URL like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/surveys/abc123?view=form&companyId=xyz`

### **Step 2: Share with Students**

**Via Whop Messaging:**
1. Go to Whop Dashboard
2. Find your students
3. Send message with survey link
4. Students click link → Opens survey

**Via Email:**
1. Export student list from Whop
2. Send email with survey link
3. Students click link → Opens survey

**Via Course Content:**
1. Add survey link to course description
2. Students see link when viewing course
3. Students click link → Opens survey

## **🎯 Method 3: Embed in Whop Content (If Supported)**

### **Step 1: Check Whop Course Editor**

**Look for these options in Whop:**
- HTML editor mode
- Custom code blocks
- Embed content options
- iframe support

### **Step 2: Test Embedding**

**Try this in a Whop lesson:**
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://your-app.vercel.app/embed/survey/abc123?companyId=xyz"
  width="100%" 
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

**If it works:** Survey appears in the lesson
**If it doesn't:** Whop doesn't support iframe embeds

## **🎯 Method 4: Whop Webhook Integration**

### **Step 1: Set Up Webhooks**

**Configure webhook in Whop:**
```
Webhook URL: https://your-app.vercel.app/api/whop/webhook
Events: course.completed, lesson.completed, user.joined
```

### **Step 2: Auto-Trigger Surveys**

**When student completes course:**
1. Whop sends webhook to your app
2. Your app creates survey link
3. Your app sends survey to student
4. Student receives notification with survey link
