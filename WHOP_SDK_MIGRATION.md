# 🎯 Whop SDK Migration Complete

## What Was Done

### ✅ **1. Installed Correct SDK**
```bash
npm install @whop/sdk
```

**Before:** `@whop/api` v0.0.50 (old/deprecated)
**After:** `@whop/sdk` (current, October 2025)

---

### ✅ **2. Created Experience-Based Routing**

**Before:**
```
/analytics?companyId=biz_xxx  ❌ Wrong pattern
```

**After:**
```
/experiences/[experienceId]  ✅ Correct Whop app pattern
```

**New Files:**
- `app/experiences/[experienceId]/page.tsx` - Main entry point
- `lib/hooks/useWhopExperience.ts` - Experience auth hook
- `lib/whop-client.ts` - New SDK client

---

### ✅ **3. Fixed Access Control**

**Before:**
```typescript
// Checked: Company access + User role
await checkIfUserHasAccessToCompany({ userId, companyId });
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Checks: Experience access (respects products!)
await client.users.checkAccess(experienceId, { id: userId });
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Respects product-based access
- ✅ Only members with products including analytics get access
- ✅ Supports tiered access (Basic vs Premium products)

---

### ✅ **4. Added Critical Metrics**

#### **Dispute Rate Tracking** 🚨
```typescript
{
  disputeRate: 1.5%,  // % of payments disputed
  disputeStatus: 'warning',  // healthy | warning | critical
  disputeWarnings: 3,  // Early alerts
  openDisputes: 2,  // Active disputes
  totalDisputes: 5
}
```

**Why Critical:**
- Dispute rate >2% = Lose ALL financing access
- Dispute rate >1% = Lose Klarna
- Creators NEED this to protect their revenue!

#### **Churn Prevention**
```typescript
{
  aboutToChurn: 12,  // Members with cancel_at_period_end
  pastDue: 5,  // At-risk members
  churnRate: 8.3%,
  cancellationReasons: ["Too expensive", "Not using it", ...]
}
```

#### **Course Completion**
```typescript
{
  completionRate: 65%,
  totalLessons: 120,
  completedLessons: 78,
  studentProgress: [...]
}
```

#### **Revenue Health**
```typescript
{
  grossRevenue: $12,450,
  netRevenue: $11,205,  // After fees
  refundedAmount: $890,
  avgLTV: $249
}
```

---

### ✅ **5. New API Routes**

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/api/experiences/[experienceId]/access` | Check user access |
| `/api/experiences/[experienceId]/analytics` | Get all analytics |
| `/api/experiences/[experienceId]/courses` | Course completion data |

---

## 🔧 **App Configuration Needed**

Go to: https://whop.com/apps → Your App → Settings

**Set these paths:**
```
Base URL: https://data-analytics-gold.vercel.app
Experience Path: /experiences/[experienceId]
Dashboard Path: /company/[companyId] (optional)
```

---

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Local Development (Use whop-proxy!):**
```bash
# Install whop-proxy globally
npm install -g @whop-apps/dev-proxy

# Run with proxy (REQUIRED for iframe auth!)
whop-proxy --command 'npm run dev'

# NOT just: npm run dev ❌
```

### **Test Flow:**
1. Install your app to a test Whop company
2. Add analytics experience to a Product
3. Open app from Whop (Settings → Localhost mode)
4. Should see analytics dashboard
5. Check console for:
   - ✅ Experience ID detected
   - ✅ Access verified
   - ✅ Metrics loaded

---

## 📊 **Data You Can Now Show**

### **From Whop SDK:**
- ✅ Payments (with dispute tracking!)
- ✅ Memberships (churn prevention)
- ✅ Members (engagement)
- ✅ Course lesson interactions
- ✅ Products & Plans
- ✅ Authorized users (team roles)

### **Critical Alerts:**
```typescript
// Dispute Rate Alert
if (disputeRate > 2.0) {
  alert("🚨 CRITICAL: Dispute rate at 2%! 
         You're losing financing access!");
}

// Churn Alert
if (aboutToChurn > 10) {
  alert("⚠️ {aboutToChurn} members canceling!
         Check cancellation reasons.");
}
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Configure Whop App Settings:**
   - Set `experience_path: /experiences/[experienceId]`
   - Request permissions: `payment:basic:read`, `member:basic:read`, etc.

2. **Update Frontend:**

   - Show dispute rate prominently
   - Add churn prevention dashboard

3. **Test with whop-proxy:**
   ```bash
   whop-proxy --command 'npm run dev'
   ```

4. **Deploy & Configure:**
   - Push to GitHub
   - Vercel auto-deploys
   - Update Whop app URL to production

## 🔐 **Security Improvements**

**Before:**
- Checked company access only
- Anyone in company could access

**After:**
- Checks experience access
- Respects product-based gating
- Only members with right products get access
