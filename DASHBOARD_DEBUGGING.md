# üêõ Dashboard Debugging - Why You're Not Seeing Data

## **Current Situation**
- ‚úÖ You're in the Whop app
- ‚úÖ Dashboard page loads
- ‚ùå No data showing
- ‚úÖ Data exists in database (2,505 events, 91 students)
- ‚úÖ Metrics are cached in database

## **The Problem**
The dashboard React component is trying to fetch data from `/api/dashboard/metrics`, but it's either:
1. **Not finding the API route** (404 error)
2. **API is timing out** (serverless function timeout)
3. **API is throwing an error** (500 error)
4. **Metric calculation is failing** (runtime error)

## **How to Check What's Happening**

### **Option 1: Check Browser Console**
While viewing the dashboard in Whop:
1. Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac) to open browser console
2. Look at the **Console** tab for errors
3. Look at the **Network** tab for failed requests
4. Screenshot any errors and send them to me

### **Option 2: Check Vercel Logs**
1. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Find your project
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Go to **Functions** tab
5. Look for `/api/dashboard/metrics` logs
6. Check for errors

## **Likely Issues**

### **Issue 1: API Route Not Deployed**
- The `/app/api/dashboard/metrics/route.ts` file exists locally
- But it might not be deployed to Vercel yet
- **Solution**: Redeploy the app

### **Issue 2: Metric Calculation Functions Failing**
- The API tries to calculate metrics on-demand
- But the calculation functions might have errors
- **Solution**: Fix the metric calculation logic

### **Issue 3: Supabase Connection Issues**
- The metric functions need to connect to Supabase
- But environment variables might be missing in Vercel
- **Solution**: Check Vercel environment variables

### **Issue 4: Serverless Function Timeout**
- Metric calculation takes too long
- Vercel free tier has 10-second timeout
- **Solution**: Use cached metrics (already done!)

## **Quick Fix: Use Static Data**

If you need to see the dashboard working RIGHT NOW, we can temporarily show the cached metrics without calculation.

Would you like me to:
1. **Check the browser console** with you to see the exact error?
2. **Create a simplified API** that just returns the cached data?
3. **Add error logging** to see what's failing?
4. **Deploy a working version** right now?
