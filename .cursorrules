# Cursor AI Rules for Git Sync

## Git Workflow Reminders

When working with this repository, always follow these practices to maintain sync:

### Before Making Code Changes
- Remind the user to run `git pull` to get the latest changes
- Check if there are uncommitted changes that might cause conflicts

### After Making Code Changes
- Remind the user to commit their changes with `git add . && git commit -m "description"`
- Remind the user to push their changes with `git push`
- Encourage clear, descriptive commit messages

### Multi-Developer Context
- This repository has multiple developers working on it
- Always pull before making changes to avoid conflicts
- Always push after completing changes to keep team in sync
- If conflicts arise, help resolve them before continuing

### Best Practices
- Commit frequently with small, focused changes
- Use clear commit messages that describe what changed
- Communicate with team members about major changes
- Pull at the start of each work session
- Push at the end of each work session

## Implementation

Before any code modifications:
- Display: "⚠️ Reminder: Run `git pull` to get latest changes before we begin."

After any code modifications:
- Display: "✅ Changes complete! Remember to:"
- Display: "   1. `git add .`"
- Display: "   2. `git commit -m 'your description'`"
- Display: "   3. `git push`"
