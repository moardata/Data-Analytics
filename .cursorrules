# Cursor AI Rules for Team Collaboration

## Git Sync Reminders

### Before Making Changes
ALWAYS remind the user to pull the latest code first:
```
⚠️ REMINDER: Pull latest code before making changes:
git pull --rebase
```

### After Making Changes
ALWAYS remind the user to commit and push their changes:
```
✅ REMINDER: Commit and push your changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

## Why This Matters
Multiple developers (and AI assistants) working on the same codebase can create conflicts. These reminders help maintain sync and prevent merge conflicts.

## Workflow
1. Pull before starting work
2. Make your changes
3. Commit and push when done
4. Communicate with your team

This ensures everyone stays in sync! 🔄
