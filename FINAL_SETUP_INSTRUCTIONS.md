# 🚀 FINAL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## ✅ What We Fixed

### **1. Installed Correct SDK**
- ✅ Added `@whop/sdk` (October 2025 version)
- ✅ Created proper SDK client in `lib/whop-client.ts`

### **2. Experience-Based Routing**
- ✅ Created `/experiences/[experienceId]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Proper access checks using experience-based model
- ✅ New hook: `useWhopExperience()`

### **3. Critical Analytics Added**
- ✅ **Dispute rate tracking** (keeps financing access!)
- ✅ **Churn prevention** (cancellation insights)
- ✅ **Course completion** (lesson tracking)
- ✅ **Revenue health** (payment metrics)

### **4. Fixed Redirect Loop**
- ✅ Updated `app/page.tsx` to preserve companyId
- ✅ Experience routing prevents loops

## 🔧 **Configuration Steps**

### **Step 1: Install whop-proxy**
```bash
npm install -g @whop-apps/dev-proxy
```

### **Step 2: Configure Whop App Settings**

Go to: https://whop.com/apps → Your App → Settings

**Set these:**
```
Base URL: https://data-analytics-gold.vercel.app
Experience Path: /experiences/[experienceId]
```

**Request these permissions:**
```
✅ payment:basic:read
✅ member:basic:read  
✅ member:email:read
✅ plan:basic:read
✅ access_pass:basic:read
✅ course_lesson_interaction:read
✅ courses:read
```

### **Step 3: Run with whop-proxy**
```bash
# Use this for local development (NOT npm run dev!)
npm run dev:whop
```

**Why whop-proxy is required:**
- Handles Whop iframe authentication
- Forwards auth headers properly
- Simulates production environment

### **Step 4: Test in Whop**

1. Install app to your test company
2. Create a Product and add your analytics experience to it
3. Open app from Whop
4. In settings, switch to "Localhost" mode
5. Should see analytics dashboard!

## 🚨 **Fix the Redirect Loop**

The redirect loop happens because:
- Whop loads: `https://wb0h4ncmg0rzlzwckn9g.apps.whop.com`
- That proxies to: `https://data-analytics-gold.vercel.app`
- Which redirects back, creating a loop

**Solution:**

Update your Whop app's **Experience Path** to:
```
/experiences/[experienceId]
```

**NOT:**
```
/ (root)  ❌ Causes redirect loop!
```

## 📊 **New Analytics Features**

### **Dispute Rate Dashboard** 🚨
Shows creators their dispute rate and warns them:
- 🟢 **< 1%**: Healthy
- 🟡 **1-2%**: Warning (losing Klarna)
- 🔴 **> 2%**: Critical (losing ALL financing!)

### **Churn Prevention**
- Members about to cancel
- Why they're leaving
- Win-back opportunities

### **Course Insights**
- Lesson completion rates
- Student progress tracking
- Drop-off points
