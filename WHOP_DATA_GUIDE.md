# üîç WHOP DATA ECOSYSTEM GUIDE
**Complete breakdown of what data Whop provides and how to access it (October 2025)**

---

## üìä WHOP DATA STRUCTURE

### **What Whop Actually Is**
Whop is a platform for selling **digital memberships** and **access passes**. It's NOT primarily a course platform - it's a **membership/community platform** that CAN host courses.

Think of it like this:
- **Primary**: Community memberships (Discord groups, Telegram channels, private content)
- **Secondary**: Courses, digital products, software licenses
- **Revenue Model**: Subscription tiers, one-time purchases, trial periods

---

## üéØ YOUR PERMISSIONS BREAKDOWN

Based on your permissions list, here's what you CAN and CANNOT access:

```
Permissions:

- payout:withdrawal:read
```

**What this means:**

**This is REAL data you can use for:**

#### **4. ACCESS PASSES**
```
Permissions:
- access_pass:basicexport
- access_pass:control_center

- access_pass:delete
- access_pass:stats:export
- access_pass:stats:read
```

**What this means:**
- Access passes are like "tickets" to specific content
- You can track who has access to what
- You can see access pass usage stats


#### **5. PROMO CODES & TRACKING LINKS**
```
Permissions:
- promo_code:basic:export
- promo_code:create
- tracking_link:basic:export
- tracking_link:stats:read
```

**What this means:**

#### **1. COURSES (The Big One)**
```

```

**What this means:**
- You CANNOT see course curriculum
- You CANNOT track lesson completions
- You CANNOT see time spent in courses
- You CANNOT track course progress

**This is why the Whop dev said your app doesn't make sense** - you claim to track "students" and "courses" but you have no course data access.


#### **2. CHAT & COMMUNITY INTERACTION**
```
You have:
- chat:manage_webhook ‚úÖ
- chat:moderate ‚úÖ
- chat:message:create ‚úÖ
- chat:read ‚úÖ
```

**What this means:**
- You CAN see chat activity
- You CAN track message counts
- This is ENGAGEMENT DATA you're not using!


#### **3. FORUM DATA**
```

```

**What this means:**

```

**What this means:**
- You can see livestream data
- Another engagement metric you're ignoring

---

## üîå HOW TO ACCESS THIS DATA

### **1. WEBHOOKS** (What you're using now)

Your webhook handler in `app/api/webhooks/route.ts` currently listens for:
```typescript
// Events you're processing:
- payment.succeeded
- membership.created
- membership.renewed
- membership.cancelled
- membership.expired
```

**Events you should ALSO be listening for:**
- `message.created` - Track chat engagement
- `forum.post.created` - Track forum activity
- `access_pass.granted` - Track content access
- `promo_code.used` - Track marketing
- `tracking_link.clicked` - Track referrals

### **2. REST API** (What you should use for detailed queries)

You have the SDK imported (`@whop/api`) but you're barely using it.

**What you SHOULD be doing:**

```typescript
import { WhopAPI } from '@whop/api';

const whop = new WhopAPI({
  apiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY
});

// Get member details
const member = await whop.members.retrieve('mem_xxxxx');

// Get company stats
const company = await whop.companies.retrieve('biz_xxxxx');

// Get all active memberships
const memberships = await whop.memberships.list({
  company_id: 'biz_xxxxx',
  valid: true
});

// Get payment history
const payments = await whop.payments.list({
  company_id: 'biz_xxxxx'
});

// Get plan statistics
const planStats = await whop.plans.retrieve('plan_xxxxx');
```

### **3. SDK ACCESS VALIDATION** (What you implemented)

```typescript
// Check if user has access (you're doing this)
const result = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToCompany({
  userId,
  companyId,
});

// Check their access level
// 'admin' = creator/owner
// 'customer' = member
// 'no_access' = unauthorized
```

## üìà WHAT YOU SHOULD BE TRACKING (REALISTIC)

Based on your ACTUAL permissions, here's what your app should track:

### **1. COMMUNITY ANALYTICS** (NOT "Student Analytics")
- Total members
- Member growth rate
- Member churn rate
- Active vs inactive members
- Member distribution by plan tier

### **2. REVENUE ANALYTICS** (You have full access)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Payment success/failure rates
- Refund rates
- Revenue by plan tier

### **3. SUBSCRIPTION ANALYTICS** (You have full access)
- Active subscriptions by tier
- Upgrade/downgrade patterns
- Trial conversion rates
- Subscription retention curves
- Cancellation reasons (if collected)

### **4. ENGAGEMENT ANALYTICS** (You're NOT using this)
- Chat message frequency
- Forum post count
- Livestream attendance
- Content reward submissions
- Time of day activity patterns

### **5. MARKETING ANALYTICS** (You have access but not using)
- Promo code performance
- Tracking link conversions

## üö® THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR APP

### **What You CLAIM to track:**
- ‚ùå "Course Analytics"
- ‚ùå "Student Progress"
- ‚ùå "Lesson Completion"
- ‚ùå "Learning Engagement"

### **What You CAN ACTUALLY track:**
- ‚úÖ Community membership growth
- ‚úÖ Revenue and subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Member tiers and upgrades
- ‚úÖ Payment patterns
- ‚úÖ Chat/forum engagement (if you implement it)
- ‚úÖ Marketing performance (if you implement it)

### **What You're CURRENTLY tracking:**
- ‚úÖ Members (called "students" incorrectly)
- ‚úÖ Events (payment, subscription events)
- ‚úÖ Subscriptions
- ‚ùå Any actual engagement data

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED PATH FORWARD

### **Option A: Pivot to "Community Analytics" (EASIEST)**

**Rebrand your app:**
- "CreatorIQ - Community & Revenue Analytics"
- "Track your Whop community growth, revenue, and member engagement"

**What to build:**
1. Member growth dashboards
2. Revenue breakdown by tier
3. Subscription lifecycle tracking
4. Chat & forum engagement metrics (NEW)
5. Marketing performance (promo codes, tracking links)

**Pros:**
- Uses data you actually have access to
- No schema changes needed
- Honest about what you track
- Still valuable to creators

### **Option B: Get Course Permissions & Build Full Course Tracking (HARD)**

**What you need:**
1. Request `courses:read` and `course_lesson_interaction:read` permissions from Whop
2. Add course tables to your database schema
3. Build course-specific webhooks
4. Create course analytics dashboards
5. Track actual learning metrics

**Pros:**
- Matches your original vision
- More valuable to course creators

**Cons:**
- Requires Whop to approve permissions
- Major database schema changes
- Significant dev work
- Not all Whop communities even use courses

---

## üìã ACTION ITEMS

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Decide Option A or Option B
2. **SHORT TERM**: 
   - If Option A: Rename "students" to "members" throughout the app
   - If Option B: Request course permissions from Whop
3. **MEDIUM TERM**:
   - Implement chat/forum engagement tracking
   - Add marketing analytics (promo codes, tracking links)
4. **LONG TERM**:
   - Build AI insights based on ACTUAL data you have
   - Create predictive churn models
   - Add automated member segmentation

---

## üîó USEFUL RESOURCES

- **Whop API Docs**: https://docs.whop.com/api-reference/v5/apps/overview
- **Whop SDK**: `@whop/api` on npm
- **Whop Developer Program**: https://whop.com/discover/whop-developer-program/
- **Your Current Implementation**: `lib/whop-sdk.ts`, `app/api/webhooks/route.ts`

---

**BOTTOM LINE**: You're trying to track "students" in "courses" but you have zero access to course data. You need to either pivot to tracking what you CAN access (members, revenue, engagement) or get additional permissions from Whop.
